# credit-card-customer-segmentation-using-clustering-algorithm
INTRODUCTION:
The "Credit Card Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Algorithm" project aims to analyze and group credit card customers based on their spending behaviour, credit usage patterns, and demographic information. By applying clustering algorithms such as K-means or hierarchical clustering, the project seeks to identify distinct customer segments within the credit card user base. This segmentation can provide valuable insights for financial institutions and credit card companies, enabling them to tailor their marketing strategies, design targeted products, and enhance customer satisfaction. Ultimately, the project aims to improve customer retention and acquisition strategies by understanding the unique needs and preferences of different customer groups in the credit card market.

PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
By the end of this project you will:
Know fundamental concepts and techniques used for Unsupervised learning.
Gain a broad understanding about data.
Have knowledge on pre-processing the data/transformation techniques on outlier and some visualization concepts.

PROJECT FLOW:
User interacts with the UI to enter the input.
Entered input is analyzed by the model which is integrated.
Once model analyses the input the prediction is showcased on the UI

To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities listed below,

Data collection
Collect the dataset or create the dataset
Visualizing and analyzing data
Univariate analysis
Bivariate analysis
Multivariate analysis
Descriptive analysis
Data pre-processing
Checking for null values
Handling outlier
Handling categorical data
Model building
Import the model building libraries
Initializing the model
Training the model
Evaluating performance of model
Save the model
Application Building
Create an HTML file
Build python code

PROJECT STRUCTURE:

We are building a flask application which needs HTML pages stored in the templates folder and a python script app.py for scripting.
Model.pkl is our saved model. Further we will use this model for flask integration.
Data folder contains dataset and Templates  folder contains html files.
